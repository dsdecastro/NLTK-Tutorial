# Python Natural Language Toolkit Tutorial
Contains the files that I created as I worked through the book _Natural Language Processing with Python â€“ Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit_ by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper. This eBook is available at <https://www.nltk.org/book/>. The text of Franz Kafka's _Metamorphosis_ was also used as a sample text in addition to the NLTK corpora.
